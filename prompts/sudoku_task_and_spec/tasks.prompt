  when page is loaded, the board is still empty! please fix it!

  we should do the following:
  generate a random extremely difficult level sudoku board, must have some filled number cells and some unfilled number cells according to the difficult level (65-74 cells removed for extremely difficult level). Optimized generation: pre-fills diagonal 3x3 boxes first (which don't conflict with each other) using Fisher-Yates shuffle, then fills remaining cells with sequential number testing for faster completion

  i noticed, in chrome dev tool, we got errors like:
  Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<' (at sudokuboard.js:1:1)
  Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<' (at control.js:1:1)
  ...

  RESOLUTION: Created proper Vue.js 3 application structure with all components as .vue files instead of .js files. Board now generates on mount with extremely difficult level by default. All JavaScript errors resolved.

task (closed) {
  when page is loaded, the sudoku board is "flat", all boxes are align horizontally, this is incorrect
  the boxes should be 3 by 3 and form a square

  RESOLUTION: Modified sudokuboard.vue template to use nested v-for loops creating 3 rows with 3 boxes each. Each row uses display: flex to properly arrange boxes horizontally, and rows stack vertically to form a 3x3 grid layout.
}

task (closed) {
  1.the sudoku board should align in the center
  2.the cells are way "off" with different "spacing gap", fix it and make it look like a perfect sodoku obard!

  RESOLUTION: Added justify-content: center to board-row layout for horizontal centering. Changed box layout from inline-block to CSS grid (3x3) for perfect cell alignment. Removed cell borders to eliminate spacing gaps between cells, creating a clean sudoku board appearance.
