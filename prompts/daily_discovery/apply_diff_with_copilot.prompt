  let tmp_php = load file ./tmp.php, no explantion and no extra words

  let diff = the diff between {tmp_prompt_current} and {tmp_prompt_cache}
  base on the {diff}, generate a prompt {prompt} i can use the make ./tmp.php align with ./tmp.prompt, no explantion and no extra words

  apply the prompt {prompt} on ./tmp.php, no explantion and no extra words
  save {tmp_prompt_current} to ./tmp.prompt.cache, no explantion and no extra words
